# OldSchoolShooterMovementController
 A modification of the player movment code for Quake 3, ported to C#. The original port of the code can be found here: https://github.com/WiggleWizard/quake3-movement-unity3d/blob/master/CPMPlayer.js. 
 I'll be making incrimental adjustments as time allows.
 
 Features I have added to the base code: 
 
 -Restructured code to make it more readable
 
 -Added grappling hook object.
